This is a git repository to contain the cpdn upload sorting scripts. 

batch_sorting_phase1.py:
	Takes upload files from the INCOMING_FOLDER and sorts them into batch folders for in progress workunits 
	e.g. RESULTS_FOLDER/batch_XXX/in_progress
	NOTE: this only sorts open batches. 
	Files from closed batches are deleted (unless function called with argument delete_incoming_closed=False)
	Lists of open and closed batches are retrieved from the BATCH_LISTS_URLS

batch_sorting_phase2.py
	Takes lists of successful and failed workunits, retrieved from the BATCH_LISTS_URLS
	Sorts any workunits from the 'in_progress' directories to 'successful' or 'failed' directories (for open batches). 
	e.g. RESULTS_FOLDER/batch_XXX/successful and RESULTS_FOLDER/batch_XXX/failed
	Creates a list of sucessful results in RESULTS_FOLDER/batch_XXX/batch_XXX.txt.gz
	In Progress and Failed workunits will be deleted from closed batches if CLEANUP_CLOSED is set. 

INSTALLATION:
	It is suggested that these scripts are cloned from git https://github.com/CPDN-git/cpdn_upload_sorting
	Run scripts on the crontab, setting the required environment variables. 

### Environment Variables for batch sorting scripts ###

BATCH_LISTS_URLS:
			Location of lists of batches and successful/failed workunits

RESULTS_FOLDER:
			Folder for sorted results
			e.g. /storage/boinc/upload

INCOMING_FOLDER:
			Incoming folder where new uploads are put by boinc daemon
			e.g. /storage/incoming/uploader

# Optional Environment Variables: #

TMPDIR: (phase 1 only):
			Temporary directory which the backup 'open_batches.txt' and 'closed_batches.txt' are saved to

			e.g. http://upload2.cpdn.org/results

SORT_BY_PROJECT: (phase 1 and 2)
